            Enter a NORAD ID of a satellite to learn a couple of facts about what's below it!

            Note: language can be left blank and defaults to English. Language code should be recognized by Wikipedia<br/>
            An improper language code will cause errors. Keep in mind that not all articles are available in all languages, and might also cause errors.
            Note2: satellites which consistently show "Null island" as their location are either defunct or the provided ID is not valid - the API I used has no way of checking it.
